Appy Hour - I am creating a happy hour app. This is going to be a database of Happy hours of bars and restaruants in NYC. Since there are no happy hour api's, I am going to create one. For this project I am going to create a database of different happy hour specials all around the city.

User Stories - A user will open the app and have the option to login/create an account/add a venue. The user can scroll through and see the different happy hours. 

I used auth for user accounts. I have one database with two tables, one is a users table where it saves a users email, username and password, the other table is the venues time, location, name, and happy hour specials. 


I plan to add swipe functionality and user profiles. So when a user swipes a certain way it will either skip the venue or save it to the user profile. I also plan to have a map of what happy hours are around you. This will allow a user to search by neighborhood. I also want to add a button where it would call an uber immediatly to your location and take you to that specific venue. And the last thing I want to add is a swipe up function that takes you to yelp where you can read reviews and etc.
